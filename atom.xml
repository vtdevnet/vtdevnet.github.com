    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Planning for the coming year for the Vermont Development Network!</h2>

<p>As the interest and size of the Vermont Development Network grows (there
are almost 100 people on our mailing list!) I thought it would be wise
to hold a planning meeting. So far we&#8217;ve held several happy hours,
a lightning talk Irene fundraiser, and participated in a Career night at
UVM. However, I&#8217;d like to get a more regular schedule down and plan out
events for the next several months. If you&#8217;re interested in shaping the
direction of VTDevNet, please join us at <a href="http://blog.maglianero.com/">Maglianero Cafe</a> in downtown Burlington on December 8, 2011 from 5:30-7pm.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Time for a few presentations!</h2>

<p>We had our first event back in May in Burlington and another happy hour
in Montpelier in August. Now we&#8217;re going to mix it up this month with
a new style of meeting - one where we get to hear a bit about what some
of the members of this group are wokring on! The idea behind &#8220;lightning
talks&#8221; is that we&#8217;ll hear from a bunch of members (around 6 or 7) for
5 minutes each to learn more about some if the interesting work we&#8217;re
all engaged in. SSG Advisor&#8217;s in Burlington have graciously offered to
host us in their offices for this meeting so we don&#8217;t have to try and
crowd around a bar somewhere!</p>

<blockquote><p>FUNDRAISER&#8211; $10 DONATION REQUESTED</p></blockquote>

<p>In light of all the devastation throughout the state, we&#8217;ve decided to
turn this event into a mini-fundraiser. I was planning to have people
chip in for pizza and beer, but instead, SSG Advisors has offered to
donate the pizza and beer so people can donate $10 for flood relief. All
the collected funds will be donated to VT Irene Flood Relief.</p>

<h3>Here are some of the presenters we have lined up:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Green Mountain Coffee Roasters - Supply -chains</li>
<li>SSG Advisors</li>
<li>Population Media Center</li>
<li>Vermont Council on World Affairs</li>
<li>Ushahidi and crisis mapping abroad and here at home</li>
<li>Stone Environmental Inc.</li>
<li>Institute for Sustainable Communities</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://vtdevnet.org/blog/2011/05/12/vermont-development-network-1st-happy-hour</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>About us</h2>

<p>Our little state needs a group dedicated to international development
discussion/networking for the many companies and scattered private
consultants to get together, share a beverage, and chat. Face time vs.
phone and email time - so we&#8217;ve created the <strong>Vermont Development Network!</strong></p>

<p>The goal is to provide a space for Vermonters interested in
international development issues and topics to network with one another,
have a little intellectual show &amp; tell, and talk shop - whatever you
like! We plan to hold informal gatherings, discussions, and community
building events with related organizations. This is a way to deepen our
professional rolodexes, requires no output but the price of beverages,
a bit of time to attend a happy hour here and there, and openness to
hanging out with like-minded professionals. We all wear jeans sometimes.</p>

<p>We will start out here in Chittenden County but with networks up and
down the state, look toward Windham and points east. We&#8217;ve also started
a LinkedIn Group (Vermont Development Network), a Facebook Group (same
name), a Twitter account (VTDevNet), and are looking into Meet-up as
well. Feel free to join/”like”/follow!</p>

<h3>Our First Event!</h3>

<p>A Happy Hour of course! No talks yet, just an opportunity to grab
a beverage and chat with your fellow VTDevNetters. Come join us at
Bistro 156 for a few appetizers and a chance to meet other international
development colleagues. We&#8217;ll have the sidewalk-facing area to
ourselves.</p>
